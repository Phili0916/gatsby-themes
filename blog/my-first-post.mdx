Why I _hate_ Jack Parkman!

First of all he plays for the White Sox. Such a second fiddle team.
I guess I should thank him now but he took great pride in embarrassing my Eliminator. Dick.
And not everyone knows this but he pees in the shower. Yup. Poor Rube slipped on Parkman's piss.
That's how he really hurt his ankle in my second season.
